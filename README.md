# doatap.gr-web-project-2021-2022
This project was developed using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL with the help of XAMPP

To run this you will need to have XAMPP installed (see: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and import the .sql file to use the database.

This web project recreates the already existing https://www.doatap.gr/ making it simpler and easier for the user to understand and use.
In this version there is the ability for the user to:

        -Login and create an account.
        -Look at their profile page which is dynamically produced using PHP.
        -Browse the site and see all the information they need about the organization and the procedure.
        -Apply for recognition of a degree from abroad.
        -Get feedback from the result of the application.
        
        
There is also the ability for an admin to:

        -Login with their account.
        -Inspect and accept/deny all the recent applications.
        
The site is using PHP to connect to the database and dynamically produce parts of pages, i.e. personal information, using a SESSION (and not cookies).
